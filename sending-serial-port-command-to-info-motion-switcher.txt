I'm proposing a project to aid in learning, and create a program that will be useful for controlling the info-motion switchers

Aren't the info-motion switchers already controlled?
Yes, but I want a test program that I can run from the computer to tell it "switch to input 2" and see if it switches to input 2, so that I know that everything outside of the PC headed toward the switcher is working correctly.
