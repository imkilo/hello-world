repository = a single project, containing folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets, readme

clone url is that copy/pastable url where you can download your own copy

to copy a current project to your pc:
git clone <url>

to find out if there is a difference
git status

to push a file up to the server
git add <filename>
git add -a (this will push up everything in the directory)

to "save" all the pushes you made and describe them
git commit -m "I added index.html"

send all your files to github.com (this is a per directory)
git push

get all your files from github.com  (this is a per directory)
git pull

so at the beginning of the day, do a 
git pull
make your changes and do 
git add -a
git commit -m "describe the incremental change made"

handling merge conflicts
after a git pull you get a merge conflict error
then delete the "HEAD" and =====
then git add -a
then git commit
then git push

a screen you can't escape from?
press Esc then :wq
